## Self-Evaluation Checklist

Tick the boxes (i.e., fill them with 'X's) that apply to your submission:

I have completed the following parts of the machine problem:

- [X] Part 1: HOFs
- [X] Part 2: Symbolic differentiation
- [X] Part 3: Meta-circular evaluator
- [X] Part 4: Free variables
- [X] Extra credit

## Summary and Reflection

I successfully implemented all parts of the machine problem, including higher-order functions, symbolic differentiation, a meta-circular evaluator, and handling free variables. The most challenging part was ensuring correct environment management in the meta-circular evaluator. The extra credit section was completed as well, but it would require further testing to improve. Overall, the assignment deepened my understanding of functional programming and recursive evaluation.
